## The Problem

You don't want to hand Calvin a zip file that looks like "phantom fart stank" 😂

**I got you!** Here are 3 ways to look PROFESSIONAL:

2. Create free account (30 seconds)
3. Drag the 'pwa' folder onto the page
4. Wait 10 seconds
5. You get a URL like: https://cipher-abc123.netlify.app
6. Send Calvin the link
7. He clicks it
8. IT WORKS!
9. You look like a boss 😎
```

#### Method B: Vercel (Also Easy)
```
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Sign up with GitHub (or email)
3. Click "Deploy" button

```

**This makes you look like a PROFESSIONAL developer, not someone sending zip files!**

## Option 2: Install Git/Node (10 minutes)

### Why This Looks Boss:
- ✅ You can push to GitHub (looks legit)
- ✅ You can use professional tools
- ✅ You can deploy with CLI
- ✅ You level up your skills

### How to Do It:

#### Step 1: Run the Install Script
```powershell
# Right-click PowerShell, "Run as Administrator"
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force

## Option 3: Make It Look Professional (2 minutes)

### If You MUST Send Files:

Don't send a random zip. Make it look INTENTIONAL:

├── CIPHER.html (renamed from index.html)
├── app.js
├── manifest.json
├── sw.js
└── README.txt
```

#### Step 2: Create START HERE.txt
```
