# Archive - Calvin Arsenal v2

This folder contains the original v2 codebase that was refactored into the MVP.

## What's Here

The original complex system with:
- 60+ files
- Node.js backend
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis queue
- 150+ features
- Full SAAS infrastructure

## Why It's Archived

Based on feedback in `docs/mikeybiffedithere.md`, this version was:
- Too complex for the target user (Calvin)
- Required too many dependencies
- Had scope creep (7 products in one)
- Couldn't be easily deployed or used

## The Transformation

See `docs/TRANSFORMATION.md` for the full story of how this became the MVP.

## Should You Use This?

**No.** Use the MVP instead (`crypto-forensics-mvp.html`).

This is kept for:
- Reference
- Learning
- Understanding the transformation
- Potential future features (after MVP validation)

## Key Lesson

**"Done is better than perfect. Shipped is better than polished. Used is better than featured."**

The MVP delivers more value in 1 file than this entire codebase did in 60+ files.
