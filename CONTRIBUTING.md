- One logical change per commit
- Reference issues when applicable

### Pull Requests
- Describe what and why
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Link to related issues
- Keep PRs focused and small

## Development Setup

No setup needed! Just open `crypto-forensics-mvp.html` in your browser.

For testing:
1. Open the file
2. Try the example: `abandon abandon ??? abandon abandon about`
3. Test voice commands (Chrome/Edge)
4. Check browser console for errors

## Reporting Bugs

Open an issue with:
- Browser and version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots if applicable
- Console errors if any

## Feature Requests

Before requesting features:
1. Check if it already exists
2. Explain the problem it solves
3. Describe your use case
4. Consider if it fits the MVP philosophy

## Philosophy

This project follows lean startup principles:
- **Start small** - One feature done well
- **Ship fast** - Iterate based on feedback
- **User value** - Solve real problems
- **Keep it simple** - Complexity is the enemy
