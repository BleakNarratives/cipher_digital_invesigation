# Architecture Overview

## Design Principles

1. **Performance First**: Worker threads, streaming, parallel processing
2. **Multi-Chain Native**: Abstracted chain interface for easy extension
3. **Enterprise Ready**: Audit logs, case management, API rate limiting
4. **ML-Powered**: Pattern detection using statistical and heuristic models
5. **Security Focused**: Zero logging of sensitive data, secure key handling
