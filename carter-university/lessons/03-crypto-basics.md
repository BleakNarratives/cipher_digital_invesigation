# Lesson 3: Cryptocurrency Basics

## What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency is digital money that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional money controlled by banks and governments, crypto is decentralized - meaning no single entity controls it.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Blockchain
A blockchain is like a digital ledger that records all transactions. Think of it as a notebook that everyone can read, but no one can erase or change past entries.

**Example:**
```
Block 1: Alice sends 1 BTC to Bob
Block 2: Bob sends 0.5 BTC to Charlie
Block 3: Charlie sends 0.2 BTC to Alice
```

Each block is linked to the previous one, forming a "chain" - hence blockchain!

### 2. Wallets
A crypto wallet is like a bank account, but YOU control it completely. It has two parts:

- **Public Key (Address)**: Like your account number - you share this to receive money
- **Private Key**: Like your password - NEVER share this! Anyone with your private key can take your crypto

**Example Address:**
```
Bitcoin: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa
Ethereum: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
```

### 3. Transactions
When you send crypto, you're creating a transaction that gets added to the blockchain.

**Transaction Parts:**
- **From**: Your wallet address
- **To**: Recipient's wallet address
- **Amount**: How much you're sending
- **Fee**: Payment to miners/validators for processing

### 4. Mining vs Staking

**Mining** (Bitcoin, older Ethereum):
- Computers solve complex math problems
- Winner gets to add the next block
- Receives crypto as reward

**Staking** (Modern Ethereum, Cardano):
- Lock up your crypto as collateral
- Get chosen to validate transactions
- Earn rewards for honest validation

## Common Cryptocurrencies

### Bitcoin (BTC)
- First cryptocurrency (2009)
- Digital gold - store of value
- Slow but very secure
- Max supply: 21 million

### Ethereum (ETH)
- Programmable blockchain
- Supports smart contracts
- Powers DeFi and NFTs
- Faster than Bitcoin

### Others
- **Litecoin**: Faster Bitcoin
- **Cardano**: Research-focused
- **Solana**: Super fast transactions
- **Polygon**: Ethereum scaling solution

## Security Basics

### DO:
✅ Write down your seed phrase on paper  
✅ Store it in a safe place  
✅ Use hardware wallets for large amounts  
✅ Double-check addresses before sending  
✅ Enable 2FA on exchanges  

### DON'T:
❌ Share your private key or seed phrase  
❌ Store keys in cloud or email  
❌ Click suspicious links  
❌ Trust "too good to be true" offers  
❌ Keep large amounts on exchanges
