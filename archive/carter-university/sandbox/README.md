# 🎮 Sandbox - Your Safe Practice Environment

## What is the Sandbox?

The sandbox is a **safe space** where you can:
- Practice terminal commands without fear
- Experiment with forensic tools
- Make mistakes and learn from them
- Test theories before using them on real cases

**Think of it like**: A flight simulator for pilots. You can crash here without consequences!

## What's Inside

```
sandbox/
├── sample-data/          # Fake evidence to practice with
├── terminal-practice/    # Terminal command exercises
├── crypto-practice/      # Cryptocurrency examples
├── osint-practice/       # OSINT investigation scenarios
└── forensics-practice/   # Full investigation scenarios
```

## How to Use the Sandbox

### 1. Always Start Here
Before trying something new, test it in the sandbox first.

### 2. It's Okay to Break Things
That's the point! Learn what NOT to do.

### 3. Reset Anytime
If you mess up, just delete and recreate the sandbox folders.

### 4. Document Your Experiments
Keep notes on what works and what doesn't.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to sandbox
cd carter-university/sandbox

# See what's available
ls

# Start with terminal practice
cd terminal-practice
cat README.md
```

## Sample Data Included

All data in the sandbox is **fake** and created for learning:
- Sample wallet addresses (not real)
- Mock transactions (fictional)
- Practice evidence files (made up)
- Example investigation reports (templates)

**You cannot harm real systems or data here!**

## Sandbox Rules

1. ✅ Experiment freely
2. ✅ Try commands you're unsure about
3. ✅ Break things on purpose to learn
4. ✅ Share what you discover
5. ❌ Don't use real wallet addresses
6. ❌ Don't use real personal information
7. ❌ Don't practice on real systems

## Getting Started

**For Complete Beginners**:
Start with `terminal-practice/01-basics.md`

**For Crypto Curious**:
Start with `crypto-practice/01-what-is-crypto.md`

**For Future Investigators**:
Start with `forensics-practice/case-001/README.md`

## Need Help?

- Each folder has its own README with instructions
- Check `../resources/faq.md` for common questions
- Review `../resources/glossary.md` for term definitions

## Reset the Sandbox

If you want to start fresh:

```bash
# From carter-university folder
cd sandbox
rm -rf *
# Then re-download or recreate the sample files
```

**Remember**: This is YOUR learning space. Use it however helps you learn best!
