I'm sure now, if I over asked, or if you under delivered,

I actually really appreciate you giving me a hard time. These are the kind of things that make them grow and build their character up at the same time as their skill set. I can't tell you how much I appreciate it, my dude! It's good stuff. Fortunately, we have way too many of these folders and files now, and so we're going to have to run through them and see which is which. the date and times modified would probably be a good indicator as to which one was the last round, but supposedly continue AI had this finished and ready to go.

I don't believe that to be the case. no sir
