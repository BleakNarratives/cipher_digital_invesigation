## What to Do After Deploying

### 1. Test It
- Open the URL
- Try each tool
- Test voice control
- Try on mobile

### 2. Share It
Send to 10 people:
- Calvin (obviously!)
- Friends in crypto
- Reddit (r/cryptocurrency, r/cryptoforensics)
- Twitter
- Discord servers

### 3. Get Feedback
Ask them:
- What did you try first?
- What worked? What didn't?
- What feature do you wish it had?
- Would you pay for this? How much?

### 4. Iterate
Based on feedback:
- Fix the biggest pain point
- Add the most-requested feature
- Improve the most-used tool

### 5. Repeat
Ship updates weekly. Keep iterating.

## Troubleshooting

### "npm not found"
Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org

### "git not found"
Install Git: https://git-scm.com/download/win

### "Permission denied"
Run PowerShell as Administrator

### "Vercel login required"
Run `vercel login` and follow prompts

---

## My Recommendation

**Do ALL THREE!**

1. **Vercel** - Your main production URL (fast, reliable)
2. **Netlify** - Backup/testing (instant deploys)
3. **GitHub Pages** - Professional presence (looks legit)

Total time: 10 minutes
Total cost: $0

## After You Deploy

Come back and tell me:
1. Which option you chose
2. What your URL is
3. What Calvin thinks

Then we'll tackle:
- Flutter mobile app
- FastAPI backend
- Full feature set

But FIRST: **Ship the PWA!**

**Stop reading. Start deploying. GO!** 🚀
